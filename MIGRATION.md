## What Was Done

Migrated the LG display plugin from Essentials v2 (net472, 4-Series) to Essentials v3 (net8). The plugin contains two device types — a two-way IP/serial controller (`LgDisplayController`) and a one-way IR controller (`LgDisplayIrController`) with its own Mobile Control messenger — plus a shared bridge join map.

The migration followed the standard v3 playbook (project file → factories → 3-Series cleanup → logging → compilation fixes → verification), then surfaced three real v3 API breaks that aren't unique to this plugin and have been added to the migration package's reference docs.

## Standard Migration Steps (no surprises)

- `.4Series.csproj` retargeted to `net8`; `SERIES4` define groups removed; `PepperDashEssentials` bumped to a v3 prerelease (see "Items for Review" #3).
- Both `DeviceFactory` files updated (`MinimumEssentialsFrameworkVersion`).
- 3-Series artifacts deleted: legacy `.csproj`, `packages.config`, `.nuspec`, `Properties/`.
- ~40 `Debug.Console`/`Debug.LogXxx` calls migrated to `this.LogXxx(...)` extension methods with PascalCase named placeholders. Static-context calls in factories and the `IrStandardCommands` static helper were handled via `Debug.LogMessage(LogEventLevel.X, …)` or removed.
- `LgDisplayController.CustomActivate()` changed from `public override` to `protected override` to match the v3 base-class visibility change.
- Stale copyright/year stamps refreshed to 2026 in `.csproj`, `Directory.Build.props`, and `README.md` (left `LICENSE.md` alone — that's the original copyright year).

## Breaking Changes Found (worth knowing for future migrations)

These were not in the v3-migration package's reference docs at the start of the session. They are now.

1. **`DisplayBase.WarmupTimer` and `CooldownTimer` field type changed** from `Crestron.SimplSharp.CTimer` to `System.Timers.Timer`. Any plugin that assigns `new CTimer(...)` to these fields will get `CS0029` at build time. Fix: switch to `new System.Timers.Timer(ms) { AutoReset = false }; t.Elapsed += ...; t.Start();`. `Stop()`/`Dispose()` calls don't change. Standalone `CTimer` use elsewhere can stay — `CTimer` itself still exists.
2. **Per-input marker interfaces removed** — `IInputHdmi1`–`IInputHdmi4`, `IInputDisplayPort1`, etc. are gone in v3. They've been superseded by the generic `IHasInputs<T>` / `ISelectableItems` pattern. Drop them from class declarations; the concrete `InputHdmi1()` / `InputDisplayPort1()` methods can stay since external callers may still use them.
3. **`PepperDash.Essentials.Devices.Displays` namespace doesn't exist in v3** (it may not have existed in v2 either — it was tolerated because of a `using` alias on the next line). The real namespace is `PepperDash.Essentials.Devices.Common.Displays`. Remove the dead `using`.

All three are now documented in the v3-migration package's `context/v2-to-v3-changes.md`, the auto-attached `.github/instructions/v3-migration.instructions.md`, and the `update-device-class` skill, so subsequent migrations should catch them up front.

## What Was NOT Changed

- **Join maps** — `LgDisplayBridgeJoinMap : DisplayControllerJoinMap` was verified end-to-end and needed no edits. Active joins are well-formed; the file contains many commented-out joins that already live on the base class — left as-is.
- **Bridge wiring** — `LinkToApi` in both controllers uses the v3-correct pattern (constructor with `joinStart`, null-checked `bridge.AddJoinMap`, `joinMap.X.JoinNumber` references, `SetCustomJoinData` for custom overrides).
- **Communication / monitor / feedback patterns** — unchanged from v2; v3 uses the same `IBasicCommunication`, `GenericCommunicationMonitor`, `BoolFeedback`/`StringFeedback` shapes.
- **`IrStandardCommands`** kept as a `public static class` with a `public static Dictionary<…>` lookup. Logging on the lookup miss path was removed entirely (see Items for Review #2).

## Items for Tech Lead Review

1. **Log placeholder bug fix at `LgDisplayController.cs` line 1162.** The original code was `Debug.LogVerbose(this, "...{1}: {0}", e, s)` — the message-template indices were inverted relative to the argument order, so the logged message would have rendered swapped. Migrated to `this.LogVerbose("...{Value}: {Error}", s, e)`, which now renders the values in their intended positions. **This changes runtime log output**. Confirm the new ordering is what was intended (it almost certainly is, but flagging because we can't know for sure).
2. **`IrStandardCommands.GetCommandValue` log call removed entirely** rather than downgraded. It's called every time the IR controller looks up a command, which is high-frequency. Removed per user preference for reducing repetitive log volume on hot paths. If you want a one-time warning when an unknown command is requested, that would need to be added back at the call site.
3. **Pinned to a prerelease NuGet version: `PepperDashEssentials 3.0.0-fix-surface-masked-device-instantiation-errors.1`** in the `.csproj`. There is no stable `3.0.0` on the feed yet; when a stable v3 ships, repin the `PackageReference`. Both factories intentionally declare `MinimumEssentialsFrameworkVersion = "3.0.0"` with no prerelease suffix: the plugin loader parses the value with `System.Version` and compares it against the running framework version with its prerelease suffix dropped, so a prerelease string would not parse and `3.0.0` is satisfied by any 3.0.0 prerelease or stable build. The factory strings do not need to change when the package is repinned.
4. **Marker interface removal** kept the `Input*()` concrete methods. They're still public — only the interface contract is gone. If anything in the broader framework still consumes `IInputHdmi1` as a discovery mechanism (unlikely, since the interface itself is gone), that consumer would also need updating. We did not survey downstream consumers in this session.

**Suggested next step:** review items 1 and 2, then merge `feature/migrate-to-v3-essentials` once the stable v3 NuGet pin is available (or merge now if the prerelease pin is acceptable for testing).
